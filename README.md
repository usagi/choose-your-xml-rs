## Note

- This is the updated version of <https://github.com/RazrFalcon/choose-your-xml-rs> (1).
  - The original repos is arhived, and the original author said "favor to <https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree#alternatives>" (2).
- But, in now, I could not build the (2), and I have the interest to the benchmarking of a latest XML crates.
  - Thus, I'd updated the fork just in now.
  - I might be not support the repos to keep the latest, but if you have an interest the benchmarking of a latest XML crates then it may work as useful scaffolding for you.
